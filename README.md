### About Me

### ðŸŒŸ Projects
- ðŸ”— [Project 1](https://github.com/Trifiatis/Trfiatis/blob/main/Untitled%20(1)-min.png?raw=true) â€“ This was my very first Blender project â€” the classic donut! I followed the tutorials to learn the basics of modeling, shading, and rendering. It was a super fun intro to 3D art and got me hooked on experimenting with textures and lighting.
- ðŸ”— [Project 2](https://github.com/Trifiatis/Trfiatis/blob/main/sword-min.png?raw=true) - This is my second Blender project a sword scene I made to practice modeling, texturing, and lighting. I wanted to give it a slightly cinematic look, with the blade resting on mossy cobblestones under warm lighting. Learned a lot about materials and composition while making this one!
